he Delhi High Court has directed the Delhi Police Commissioner to immediately suspend the accused police officials in the incident which took place outside Tis Hazari Court on Saturday.

Further action will also be taken by the Commissioner as an independent commission for internal enquiry has already been formed.

The Delhi Police Commissioner will complete the internal enquiry within six weeks and submit the report to the court.

The Delhi Police on Sunday told the high court that a special investigation team has been formed to look into the clash between lawyers and police at Tis Hazari court.

What happened?

Lawyers and police had clashed at Tis Hazari Court complex in New Delhi on Saturday afternoon during which at least 20 police personnel and several lawyers were injured while 17 vehicles vandalised, according to officials and eyewitnesses.

Two station house officers (SHOs) and an additional commissioner were among the 20 personnel injured, police said and claimed that eight lawyers were hurt in the incident.

Lawyers, however, said more of their colleagues were injured than the number claimed by police. They also claimed that two advocates were injured in police firing, but police said they fired in the air.



Multilayer technique to secure data transfer in private cloud

Introduction:

Cloud computing is a combination of software and hardware assets, which are given to customers remotely on request through the web. These new specialized, inventive and evaluating openings have made an extraordinary change in the methods for business operations [1] [2]. Cloud computing is improvement of numerous old ideas and techniques [3]. Cloud computing enables its clients to utilize the virtual assets on request by means of internet [4]. Cloud computing security or, essentially, cloud security alludes to a wide arrangement of strategies, advancements, applications, and controls used to ensure virtualized IP, information, applications, administrations, and the related framework of distributed computing [5]. It is a sub-area of computer security, organization security, and, all the more extensively, data security. Various security dangers are related with cloud information administrations: not just customary security dangers, for example, organized eavesdropping, unlawful intrusion, and forswearing of administration assaults, yet in addition explicit cloud computing dangers, for example, side channel assaults, virtualization vulnerabilities, and maltreatment of cloud services. Security requirements like Confidentiality, Access Controllability and Integrity limit the security threats to cloud environments.
A firewall is a product or firmware that authorizes a lot of rules about what information will be permitted to enter or leave a network [6]. A firewall's fundamental intention is to channel traffic and lower the hazard that malevolent data packets going over the open web will have the option to affect the security of a private arrange. Firewalls are consolidated into a wide assortment of organized gadgets and may likewise be bought as remain solitary programming applications. A firewall in a perfect world disposes of, or if nothing else lessens, introduction to outer hosts, conventions and systems that are known to be vectors for organized dangers. It is the establishment from which current system security advancements manufacture.
The objective of video steganography is to accomplish the goal of hidden communication and send secret data to the desired side securely [7]. Video is fundamentally a mix of various frames and every one of the frames establishing a video has a fixed frame rate. These frames are crucial structures for the video just as for video encryption process. Visual images are moved in the form of digital data in a digital video. Whereas, visual images are moved in the form of analog data in analog video. Video compression is an innovation utilized for changing the video signals by maintaining original quality under different circumstances, for example,  constraints such as storage, power and time delay. By misusing the information excess between sequential frames and computational assets, the requirement of storage is diminished.
Numerous steganographic techniques have been proposed in the ongoing years [8] [9] [10]. The most widely recognized of these is supplanting Least Significant Bit (LSB) of the pixels with the message bits [11]. A decent steganography procedure goes for three angles: capacity (most extreme data that can be covered up inside the cover picture), visual nature of stego-picture must stay unaltered and strength [12]. In proposed strategy Least Significant Bit(LSB) method is chosen since it is basic and simple method for concealing data, effectively comprehend by users and the information is covered up by supplanting the least significant bit of every pixel. Be that as it may, when we shroud more information into a picture by utilizing LSB, it initiates more noise and subsequently quality of picture changes at the pixels where the information is covered up and the security of data is less as somebody can identify the message by recouping the least significant bit of the pixels from the picture. In this way, the need of evacuation of noise is critical to give the better security and nature of the picture in the wake of concealing the more information into it [13]. 
Paper is organized as follows:

Literature Survey:

We survey a couple of chosen literary works that are important for  cloud application security portrayed as follows. Existing papers [14], [15], [16], [17], [18] characterize cloud application administration security as dangers, vulnerabilities and assurance of cloud operational administrations and software as a service. Liu et al. [14] has proposed a framework which analyses security requirements. In any case, it is seen so far another demonstrating language than security necessities catching structure. Mather et al. [15] gives a definition and portrayal on different cloud security and protection issues. However, there is no unmistakable structure to pursue from security prerequisites. Cebula and Young [18] further characterize cloud applications security and its execution into two significant gatherings: software acquisition security (which incorporates the security determinations in all procedures to purchase, lease, or trade programming to use in an undertaking) and frameworks and programming advancement security (which incorporate the security particulars in all procedures to create data frameworks). There is no reasonable system to characterize security necessities and afterward to feed towards usage. A system with an all encompassing approach of offering a coordinated arrangement and multi-layered security is required.
The authors in [19] propose a successful HMM-based intrusion detection framework that improves the performance time and execution by considering the benefit progress streams dependent on the domain of attacks. A Hidden Markov model (HMM) is a valuable device to show data sequence, minimizing the false-positive error and at the same maximizing detection rate. 
Paper [20] gives a survey and examination of the diverse existing strategies for steganography and computerized watermarking alongside some basic benchmarks and rules. The major drawback of this work is that the output video in which data is hidden is not easily recognizable. Authors in [21] proposed that their work manages security utilizing Steganography. In this innovation, the end client distinguishes a video which is going to go about as the carrier of information. The approach is utilized free of the host Video and demonstrates to be very vigorous as the hidden message can endure transformation among lossy and lossless compression. The downside of this work is that the video contains some information, we cannot include some more information for the same video. In [22] another steganography way to deal with encoding the secret message behind the audio and video file. The authors additionally suggested that the LSB technique was easy to use for the secret data in a computerized document. The principle goal of this paper was to give security during information transmission. The primary drawback of this work is Echo hiding, Parity coding and high capacity of data.
Blowfish algorithm and LSB method have been utilized separately to encode the secret message and to hide it into the bits of the video frames in [23]. Authors claim that the blowfish algorithm is superior to different algorithms and assessed their work of hiding into video frames as a novel approach in the steganographic field. The way toward keeping up secrecy developed around steganography has been attempted in the field of electronic voting in [24]. The strategies are LSB and the Minimal Impact Decimal Digit Embedding (MIDDE). The paper [25] advises about a way to deal with perceiving LSB steganography. This methodology depends on statistical measures of test sets. Limits on estimation errors of this straightforward and quick approach have likewise been evaluated.
The cryptographic systems which are suitable to this paper are AES-ECB, AES-CBC and AES-CTR [26]. In the ECB mode, the plain text is isolated into squares and each square is encrypted by a key. The squares are encoded in confinement to each other. At last, the encrypted results of each square are compared to deliver the cipher text. AES-CBC pursues a similar rule; in CBC each information square is converged with the encoded result of the former square. Besides, along with the key an Initialization Vector (IV) is utilized for encryption. Accordingly the last cipher text will depend on all the information blocks that have been determined to that point. In AES-CTR, IVs go about as information squares and are encrypted with the key. The plain text is then hidden in the encrypted results of each square. IVs of progressive squares are framed by increasing the IV of the past square, in this way the name counter or CTR.




Methodology

1.1 Layer 1 : Firewall Intrusion 
The first layer provides the epidermal security to the whole system using the Firewall technique. This intrusion detection ensures that data is safeguarded at every point of time. The firewall acts as a core of network security and annihilates any risk of malevolent intrusion. There are two techniques to setup firewall around the private cloud. One way is to set-up a stand alone or central Firewall and the other is to have a distributed firewall set-up.

A traditional central firewall is clustering of a router, proxy and gateway system. It’s exactly between the private cloud and the distrustful outside network, like Interconnected Network. But the major limitation is, it cannot protect the hosts present inside the cloud network from internal attacks. The firewall authorizes the traffic which follows the policy set inside the firewall. The central firewall can become the choking point in the case of incessant traffic.   The distributed technique ensures packet filtering from both external and internal  traffic as this intrusion prevention system is present on every host. It not only prevents the attacks from external systems but also protects the host from inside the cloud hacking or attacks. Thus to achieve maximum cloud security in private cloud system, it is safe to use Distributed host based firewall. Ultimate security can be achieved by the combination of both central and distributed network based Firewall setup. For further knowledge about the process of setting up of firewall [27] can be referred.

1.2 Layer 2 : HMM Based intrusion detection and prevention
HMM is a arithmetic Markov model in which the system being modeled is presumed to be a Markov method with hidden states. The states in a system at time t is dependent on the state of the system at time t-1. Since there are sequence of observations present in the system like the user’s past usage of data or storage in the system or the time spent by each user for a particular task in the system, thus HMM based intrusion detection and prevention technique is used. In the cloud environment as soon as data transfer takes place the HMM with certain parameters, as mentioned above is initialized. With each data transfer, HMM starts calculating the probability of each transfer in the progression state. Now if the probability of data transfer increases a certain threshold amount, then intrusion is detected and data transfer is terminated. [28] gives detailed algorithm to implement the intrusion detection and prevention in a cloud environment.
